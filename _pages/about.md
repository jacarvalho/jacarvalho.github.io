<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a research assistant at the 
<b><a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/" target="_blank">Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS)</a></b> 
group from
<b><a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/" target="_blank">TU Darmstadt</a></b>,
where I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science advised by
<b><a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters" target="_blank">Jan Peters</a></b>.
<br>
My research interests are developing <b> machine learning</b> and <b>reinforcement learning</b> algorithms for <b>robot manipulation</b>. 
These include methods that leverage generative models for motion planning and grasping, reinforcement learning methods to solve contact-rich tasks like insertions, or improving policy gradient methods with variance reduction techniques.

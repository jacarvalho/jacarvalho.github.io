<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am research assistant at the 
<a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/" target="_blank">Intelligent Autonomous Systems Group</a>
from TU Darmstadt, where I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science avised by
<a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters" target="_blank">Jan Peters</a>.
<br>
My research interests are developing <b> machine learning</b> and <b>reinforcement learning</b> algorithms for robot manipulation. 
These include methods that leverage generative models for motion planning and grasping, reinforcement learning methods to solve contact-rich tasks like insertions, or improving policy gradient methods with variance reduction techniques.
